## I was unable to upload the demo video on google drive link shared, I have shared the public drive link to the video in the form and here is the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LNPxmftj0yXtDEArdRkpbS2mmPreFLoq/view?usp=sharing

## The following assumptions have been made about the json file that user will upload:
- File is in json format
- File name does not contain any spaces or special characters (please remember this)
- The file has data fields : "userid", "id", "title", "body"

## Tech used:
- Django (backend)
- HTML (frontend)
- SQLite (databsse)

## Instructions to run the project:
- pip install django
- navigate to folder with file "manage.py"
- run command python manage.py runserver
- go to link "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
- ignore any terminal logs

## The ui can do the following:
- register user
- login/logout user
- upload json file
- view json file data
